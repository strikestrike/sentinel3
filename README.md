# Terracoin Sentinel

An all-powerful toolset for Terracoin.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/terracoin/sentinel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/terracoin/sentinel)

Sentinel is an autonomous agent for persisting, processing and automating Terracoin V12.1.8 governance objects and tasks.

Sentinel is implemented as a Python application that binds to a local version 12.1.8 terracoind instance on each Terracoin V12.1.8 Masternode.

This guide covers installing Sentinel onto an existing 12.1.8 Terracoin masternode in Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04.

## Installation

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Make sure Python version 2.7.x or above is installed:

    python --version

Update system packages and ensure virtualenv and git are installed:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install python-virtualenv git

Make sure the local Terracoin daemon running is at least version 12.1.8 (120108)

    ./terracoin-cli getinfo | grep version

### 2. Install Sentinel

Clone the Sentinel repo and install Python dependencies.

    git clone https://github.com/terracoin/sentinel.git && cd sentinel
    virtualenv ./venv (your VPS may not come with virtualenv to install type: apt install virtualenv)
    ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Set up Cron

Set up a crontab entry to call Sentinel every minute:

    crontab -e

In the crontab editor, add the line below, replacing '/home/YOURUSERNAME/sentinel' to the path where you cloned sentinel to.

    * * * * * cd /home/YOURUSERNAME/sentinel && SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py >> sentinel.log 2>&1
    
If you followed a guide where it had you install Terracoin to the root directory your path to where you cloned sentiel will be:

    * * * * * cd /root/sentinel && SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py >> sentinel.log 2>&1

## Configuration

An alternative (non-default) path to the `terracoin.conf` file can be specified in `sentinel.conf`:

    terracoin_conf=/path/to/terracoin.conf

## Troubleshooting

To view debug output, set the `SENTINEL_DEBUG` environment variable to anything non-zero, then run the script manually:

    SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

To view the debug output in real time enter:

    tail -f sentinel.log
   
## Contributing

Please follow the [TerracoinCore guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin/blob/v0.12.1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Specifically:

* [Contributor Workflow](https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin/blob/v0.12.1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-workflow)

    To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

    * Fork repository
    * Create topic branch
    * Commit patches

    In general commits should be atomic and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes.

    Commit messages should be verbose by default, consisting of a short subject line (50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate paragraph(s); unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo in main.cpp") then a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should be helpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for your decisions. Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
